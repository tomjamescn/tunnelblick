<blockquote>NOTE: This version will refuse to install or launch on a computer that has ever had a "<a href='cCusDeployed.md'>Deployed</a>" version installed unless that version has been completely <a href='cInstall#Uninstalling_Tunnelblick.md'>uninstalled</a>.

These downloads have been contributed by users and usually help deal with special circumstances. They are not endorsed or checked by the Tunnelblick project or Google, and you use them at your own risk. To contribute a download, please email project owner <a href='http://code.google.com/u/jkbullard/'>Jon</a>.</blockquote>

<ul><li><b>Scripts to Unload Cisco Tun Kext</b>:  <i><b><a href='http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/detail?name=user-contributed-001-pre-post.zip'>user-contributed-001-pre-post.zip</a></b></i> Contributed by petiepooo. These scripts unload the Cisco AnyConnect tun kext before a Tunnelblick connection is started, and reload the Cisco tun kext after a Tunnelblick connection is stopped. (The Cisco kext interferes with Tunnelblick's operation of tun connections.) Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Scripts to Mount/Unmount a Volume</b>:  <i><b><a href='http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/detail?name=user-contributed-002-mount-unmount-volume.zip'>user-contributed-002-mount-unmount-volume.zip</a></b></i> Contributed by John Griffis. These scripts mount a volume after a configuration is connected and unmount it when the configuration is disconnected. Scripts must be edited before use (in any plain-text editor) to specify details of the volume to be connected. Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher. For a note about connecting to a CIFS account, see <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion'><a href='https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion'>https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion</a></a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Scripts to Monitor Connection Time and Bandwidth Use</b>:  <i><b><a href='http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/detail?name=user-contributed-003-monitor-uptime-and-bandwidth.zip'>user-contributed-003-monitor-uptime-and-bandwidth.zip</a></b></i> Contributed by "vkapovit". These scripts  provide a mechanism for the user to be alerted when the VPN has been up for more than 20 minutes or when bandwidth has exceeded 100MB. See <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tunnelblick-discuss/7lGWKR1-rC4/OGHhCfmrXfgJ'>this post</a> on the Tunnelblick Discussion Group for details. Requires Growl. Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher. <strong><font color='red'>Includes compiled binaries; use at your own risk.</font></strong>

<blockquote><h2>Verifying Downloads</h2>
Verifying downloads is a good idea. Even though the .dmg format and the application's OS X digital signature provide some protection, you can also compare the SHA1 checksum and the MD5 hash of your downloaded file with the official published ones.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To compute the checksum and hash of a file you've downloaded, type the following into /Applications/Utilities/Terminal:<br>
<blockquote>openssl sha1 <i>path-to-the-file</i>
</blockquote>and<br>
<blockquote>openssl md5 <i>path-to-the-file</i></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>The SHA1 checksum and the MD5 hash of current Tunnelblick binaries are shown above, under the link to the binaries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For older binaries hosted on SourceForge, go to<br>
<blockquote><a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/tunnelblick/files/All%20files'>https://sourceforge.net/projects/tunnelblick/files/All files</a>
</blockquote>and find the file in the list. Click on the little "information" icon (the white "i" in a dark circle) to the right of the file's name in the line. The SHA1 checksum and MD5 hash of the file will be displayed along with some other information.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Note: There are two files for each download, an X.dmg and an X-updater.dmg. The files are identical. Downloads from Tunnelblick's Google Code website use X.dmg and updates from within the Tunnelblick application use X-updater.dmg.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>For even older binaries hosted on Google Code, the SHA1 checksum is shown on the page with the download.</blockquote>
